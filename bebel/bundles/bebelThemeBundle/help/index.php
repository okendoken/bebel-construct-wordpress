		<h3 id="introduction"><strong>A) Introduction</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
        	People is a lightweight premium theme that will help your company get more attention without doing too much work.
        </p>

        <p style="font-style:italic; color: #C63">We have created some screencasts that will guide you through the theme. They are uploaded to youtube.</p>

        <p>
   			First, let me tell you some requirements of this theme.
        </p>

        <ol>
        	<li>PHP version <strong>5.1</strong> or higher.<br />This is absolute necessary. If your host is still running on php4, you put yourself and others in danger. The version 4 is officially not supported anymore. It has a lot of security issues!</li>
            <li>Wordpress version <strong>3</strong> or higher. We developped this theme for wordpress 3 and tested every single functionality in wordpress 3.3. It works.</li>
            <li>Mailchimp account. If you want to get the full power of this theme, you should get a mailchimp account. The free one is good enough ;)</li>
        </ol>

		<h3 id="installation"><strong>B) Installation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>You have two ways of installing the theme. You can upload it throug the wordpress theme uploader, which is the most simple solution, or you can upload it via ftp.</p>

        <h4 id="installation-wordpress"><strong>The Wordpress Way</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>

		<p>There is a great tutorial on how do to that on the wordpress site. <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Themes_SubPanel#Using_the_upload_method">Click here to access it</a> (redirecting to wordpress.org)</p>


        <h4 id="installation-ftp"><strong>Using FTP</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>

        <p>For this, there is a great tutorial on wordpress.org, too. <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Themes_SubPanel#Using_the_FTP_method">Access it here</a>.</p>


        <h4 id="installation-errors"><strong>Installation Errors</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>

		<p>If you experience any errors during the installation, please read this short section before contacting us.</p>

        <ol>
        	<li>
            	I get the error: "Unexpected T_OLD_FUNCTION" or something similar: Please upgrade to php5.1. We don't support any prior versions.<br />
                To update, refer to your host's documentation.
            </li>
            <li>
            	Wordpress tells me the stylesheet is broken.<br /> This error comes often, when you upload the files via ftp, but the upload somehow was not completed. Remove all the theme's files from your server and upload again.
            </li>
            <li>
            	I get the error: "Undefined function xyz".<br />As above, this is an indicator that the files could not be completely uploaded. Reupload to be sure!
            </li>
        </ol>

		<h3 id="installed"><strong>C) Uploaded. Installed. Activated. What now?</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

        <p style="font-style:italic; color: #C63">prolog: in this tutorial / help file, we use some links to get you to the relevant sections of the wordpress configuration quickly and smoothly. They will only work if you read this tutorial in the help section of the theme's configuration panel. Read below how to access it</p>

		<p>Congratulations!</p>

        <p>
        	Lets get started! First of all, go to the theme's configuration panel. After the theme activation, you will notice there is a new point called "People" beneith "Appearance" (Where you just activated the theme). <br />
            This is where all of the themes settings come together and are managed. You'll notice 5 points.
        </p>

        <ol>
			<li>Theme Configuration</li>
			<li>Installation / Reset</li>
			<li>Help &amp; Support</li>
		</ol>

        <h4 id="theme-configuration"><strong>1) Theme Configuration</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>

        <p>The first point, <em>Theme Configuration</em>, lets you, you might have guessed rightly, configure the theme's settings. We have plenty of them, but all are pretty self explicatory. </p>


        <h4 id="sidebar-generator"><strong>2) Installation / Reset</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>

        <p>This is where you can find the one click installation, in case you skipped it while installing the theme. </p>

        
        <h4 id="help-support"><strong>4) Help &amp; Support</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>

        <p>The fourth point, <em>Help &amp; Support</em> contains this help file. You don't have to worry if you log on from another computer. You can always read this documentation in your WordPress backend.</p>
        


        <h3 id="setup-theme"><strong>D) Setting the theme up</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

        <p>This part has a video and some text. Please read and watch both. It will teach you all the important things about the theme. Please watch it, as it contains several important information!</p>
        
        <h4>Withouth the autoinstall feature</h4>
        <iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CaOtfitLvwo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        
        <h4>With the autoinstall feature</h4>
        
        <p>When activating the theme, or by clicking on "Installation / Reset" found in the theme menu, you can install the theme automatically. Now, this does not set up the page like the demo. 
            We can not do this because of the image licensing and copyright of the images we provide on the demo. So we set up a easy to start with xml file, which will be automatically inserted into your installation.</p>
        <p>Just follow the steps written on the one click installation page and you are ready to go.</p>

        <h3 id="setup-menu"><strong>E) Settig Up the Menu</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
        
        <p>We use the default way of wordpress to set up the menu. Please read this tutorial of the wordpress documentation: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Menu_User_Guide" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Menu_User_Guide</a></p>

        <h3 id="activating-mailchimp"><strong>H) Activating Mailchimp</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

        <p>
            What is Mailchimp?<br />
            It’s one of the best and easiest ways to send newsletter campaigns over the internet these days. It’s free to sign up for and very cheap even for bigger campaigns (check out there free plan, which is incredible)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Follow these steps to activate and use Mailchimp with People Event Theme
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to your WordPress backend and to the „Theme Configuration“ within the People menu.</li>
            <li>Click on the tab events and scroll down. Choose „Enable Mailchimp“</li>
            <li>Save your changes</li>
            <li>Go to <a href="http://mailchimp.com" target="_blank">Mailchimp.com</a> and create an account</li>
            <li>In the Mailchimp backend menu – go to „Account Api Keys & Authorized Apps“</li>
            <li>Click on „add a key“ to create an API Key</li>
            <li>Copy that key and go back to your WP Backend.</li>
            <li>Go to your WordPress backend and to the „Theme Configuration“ within the People menu. Notice the new Mailchimp tab on top – click on it!</li>
            <li>You can now paste your API Key in the appropriate box and ckeck if then key is correct. Click on save changes and the big part is already done.</li>
            <li>Choose a default list from mailchimp in the field below. If you don't have a list set up yet, read below.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>You now activated Mailchimp. Congratulations! There is one more thing you have to do. Mailchimp works with lists, which means you can add a list to each of your event. In order to do so you have to create these lists in the Mailchimp backend on mailchimp.com</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <a href="http://mailchimp.com" target="_blank">Mailchimp.com</a> and sign in</li>
            <li>click on „lists“ on the top navigation.</li>
            <li>Click on the big red button that says „create list“</li>
            <li>Create as many lists as you need. You can create a special list for each event or simply one list for all newsltter subscriptions</li>
            <li> Go back to wordpress. You now have to tell your events which lists to use, if you don't want to use the same for all of them. In this case, follow step 10 from the list above. So got to „events“ and edit or create a new event you want to assign a list to. Once you opened that event event you will notice that shiny new Mailchimp tab in the People options. Click on it on choose the appropriate list. Click on update or publish and that’s it. Mailchimp integration is done :-)</li>
        </ol>

		<h3 id="your-code"><strong>J) Extending and Modifying the Theme</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>I am pretty sure you want to extend or / and modify the theme's layout and functionality to fit your needs. Here are a few points, you should remember when modifying any files.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Do never modify any css file we deliver (except custom.css)</li>
			<li>Do never modify any php file we deliver (except myFunctions.php)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Why that? Because of possible updates in the future. We do not give support for custom modified files. </p>
		<p>However, all template files (header-*.php, footer.php, comments.php and the files in the templates/ folder) and images can of course be modified. The restrictions are only valid for the bebel folder, and the functions.php</p>
		
		<h4 id="your-css"><strong>1) Custom CSS</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>
		
		<p>You have several points of adding your custom CSS.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Put the code in the Theme Configuration Panel</li>
			<li>Put the code in the custom.css inside the css folder</li>
			<li>Add CSS to every page where you need it.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h5>1. Theme Configuration Panel</h5>
		<p>Simply write the css code inside the field found at "Misc/Styling".</p>
		<img src="<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri().BebelUtils::getBundlePath() ?>/bebelThemeBundle/help/images/extend/css_backend.png" />
		
		<h5>2. css/custom.css</h5>
		<p>Paste the code into the custom.css file. The only difference to point 1. is that you can edit it in your favorite css editor.</p>
		
		
		<h5>3. Add to Post</h5>
		<p>This option should only be used if you have a css class only for one or two posts. This output won't be cached!</p>
		<img src="<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri().BebelUtils::getBundlePath() ?>/bebelThemeBundle/help/images/extend/css_post.png" />
		
		
		<h4 id="your-php"><strong>2) Custom PHP</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h4>
		
		<p>If you have functions you wish to add to the theme, do not paste them in the functions.php. Put them in "myFunctions.php". This file is included in functions.php at the very bottom to make sure your options override ours. </p>
